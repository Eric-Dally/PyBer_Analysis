# Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

Using Python and Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data for a company named PyBer. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Based on my analysis, I was able to determine how the ride-sharing data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Results:
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
