# Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

Using Python and Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Based on my analysis, I was able to determine how PyBer data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Results:
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

# Summary:
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
